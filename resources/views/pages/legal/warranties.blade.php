            <h3>WOODEN VENETIAN BLIND SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
            <p>Slight warp age, as well as natural variations in colour and grain effect, are normal with a wood product and are
                not considered defects. In addition, some fading and/or discoloration of the finish may occur over time. This is
                common with man-made coatings and is not considered a defect. </p>
            <p>The wood used in Taylor’s 50mm venetian window blinds is hand selected, kiln-dried Basswood which has a
                natural insulating properties to keep winters warm and summers cool. The slats have been stained and sealed
                in one of the various colour finishes, we offer. Basswood has successfully been used in venetian blind
                manufacture for over 100 years, but the natural characteristics of wood should be borne in mind. </p>
